## 2023 Reading List: Notes and Recommendations from me :D

Hello everyone! My name is Sarah and I'm a backend developer. I've recently started writing articles on GitHub about my journey in backend development, with a focus on Python and the Django framework. üòÑ

Most of my articles will be about the latest things I've learned and my experiences as a backend developer. I'll be sharing tips, tricks, and best practices that I've picked up along the way, as well as any challenges and setbacks I've encountered.

I hope my articles will be helpful to those of you who are also interested in backend development, especially with Django. ‚ù§Ô∏è

I'm always open to feedback and suggestions, so feel free to leave a comment or reach out to me if you have any ideas for future articles.

Thanks for stopping by, and I hope you enjoy reading my articles!
