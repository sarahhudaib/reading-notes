# SQL

`SQL`, or `Structured Query Language`, is a standard programming language used for managing and manipulating data in a relational database management system (`RDBMS`). `PostgreSQL`, also known as `Postgres`, is a powerful open-source `RDBMS` that has gained significant popularity over the years due to its advanced features and robustness. In this article, we will discuss the basics of `SQL` and its application in `PostgreSQL`, as well as the popular `PostgreSQL` management tool, `pgAdmin`.

## SQL
`SQL` is used for various tasks, including creating, modifying, and deleting database structures, inserting, updating, and deleting data in a database, and querying data from a database. It uses a set of commands or statements that can be executed against a database. These commands include SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, and DROP, among others.

## PostgreSQL
`PostgreSQL` is a free and open-source RDBMS that supports various advanced features, including nested transactions, user-defined types, and stored procedures. It is compatible with many programming languages, including C, C++, Java, Perl, Python, Ruby, and many others. PostgreSQL is known for its stability, reliability, and performance, making it a popular choice for many applications.

## PgAdmin
`PgAdmin` is a popular PostgreSQL management tool that provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for managing PostgreSQL databases. It is an open-source tool that is available for Windows, Linux, and macOS. With pgAdmin, you can manage database objects such as tables, views, and indexes, execute SQL queries, and monitor server activity, among other things.

##  Windows Installation - PostGreSQL and PgAdmin with Database Setup
To get started with PostgreSQL and pgAdmin, you first need to install them. PostgreSQL can be installed on Windows, Linux, or macOS, and pgAdmin can be installed on any of these operating systems as well. Once installed, you can create a new database using pgAdmin, create tables and other database objects, and insert data into the database. You can also execute SQL queries using the pgAdmin Query Tool or the PostgreSQL command-line interface (CLI).
