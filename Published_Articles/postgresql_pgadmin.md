# SQL

`SQL`, or `Structured Query Language`, is a standard programming language used for managing and manipulating data in a relational database management system (`RDBMS`). `PostgreSQL`, also known as `Postgres`, is a powerful open-source `RDBMS` that has gained significant popularity over the years due to its advanced features and robustness. In this article, we will discuss the basics of `SQL` and its application in `PostgreSQL`, as well as the popular `PostgreSQL` management tool, `pgAdmin`.

## SQL
`SQL` is used for various tasks, including creating, modifying, and deleting database structures, inserting, updating, and deleting data in a database, and querying data from a database. It uses a set of commands or statements that can be executed against a database. These commands include SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, and DROP, among others.

## PostgreSQL
`PostgreSQL` is a free and open-source RDBMS that supports various advanced features, including nested transactions, user-defined types, and stored procedures. It is compatible with many programming languages, including C, C++, Java, Perl, Python, Ruby, and many others. PostgreSQL is known for its stability, reliability, and performance, making it a popular choice for many applications.

## PgAdmin
`PgAdmin` is a popular PostgreSQL management tool that provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for managing PostgreSQL databases. It is an open-source tool that is available for Windows, Linux, and macOS. With pgAdmin, you can manage database objects such as tables, views, and indexes, execute SQL queries, and monitor server activity, among other things.

##  Windows Installation - PostGreSQL and PgAdmin with Database Setup
To get started with PostgreSQL and pgAdmin, you first need to install them. PostgreSQL can be installed on Windows, Linux, or macOS, and pgAdmin can be installed on any of these operating systems as well. Once installed, you can create a new database using pgAdmin, create tables and other database objects, and insert data into the database. You can also execute SQL queries using the pgAdmin Query Tool or the PostgreSQL command-line interface (CLI).

## SQL Statements Fundamentals

> Let's dive into some of the most commonly used SQL commands and their usage in PostgreSQL.

### **SELECT**
The `SELECT` command is used to query data from a table in a database. It allows you to retrieve one or more columns from one or more tables based on certain criteria. Here's an example:

```
SELECT * FROM employees;
```

##### This command will retrieve all columns from the employees table.

### **SELECT DISTINCT**
The `SELECT DISTINCT` command is used to retrieve unique values from a table. Here's an example:

```
SELECT DISTINCT department FROM employees;
```

##### This command will retrieve distinct department names from the employees table.

### **COUNT**
The `COUNT` command is used to count the number of rows in a table that meet certain criteria. Here's an example:

```
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employees 

WHERE department = 'Sales';
```

##### This command will count the number of employees in the Sales department.

### **SELECT WHERE**
The `SELECT WHERE` command is used to retrieve data from a table based on certain conditions. Here's an example:

```
SELECT * FROM employees 

WHERE salary > 50000;
```

##### This command will retrieve all columns from the employees table where the salary is greater than 50,000.

### **ORDER BY**
The ORDER BY command is used to sort the result set in ascending or descending order based on one or more columns. Here's an example:

```
SELECT * FROM employees 

ORDER BY last_name ASC, first_name ASC;
```

##### This command will retrieve all columns from the employees table and order the result set by last name in ascending order, and then by first name in ascending order.

### **LIMIT**
The `LIMIT` command is used to limit the number of rows returned by a query. Here's an example:

```
SELECT * FROM employees 

LIMIT 10;
```

##### This command will retrieve the first 10 rows from the employees table.

### **BETWEEN**
The `BETWEEN` command is used to retrieve values that fall within a specified range. Here's an example:

```
SELECT * FROM employees 

WHERE salary BETWEEN 40000 AND 60000;
```

##### This command will retrieve all columns from the employees table where the salary falls between 40,000 and 60,000.

### **IN**
The `IN` command is used to retrieve values that match any one of a specified set of values. Here's an example:

```
SELECT * FROM employees 

WHERE department IN ('Sales', 'Marketing');
```

##### This command will retrieve all columns from the employees table where the department is either Sales or Marketing.

### **LIKE/ILIKE**
The `LIKE/ILIKE` command is used to retrieve values that match a specified pattern. The `ILIKE` command is case-insensitive. Here's an example:

```
SELECT * FROM employees 

WHERE first_name LIKE 'J%';
```

##### This command will retrieve all columns from the employees table where the first name starts with the letter J.

### **% _%**
The `%` and `_` characters are wildcards used with the `LIKE/ILIKE` command. The `%` character represents any number of characters, while the `_` character represents a single character. Here's an example:


```
SELECT * FROM employees 

WHERE last_name LIKE 'Sm_th';
```
##### This command will retrieve all columns from the employees table where the last name is Smith, Smyth, or any other last name that matches the pattern.

## pgAdmin

If you're looking for a user-friendly way to manage your `PostgreSQL` database, look no further than `PgAdmin`. As an open-source graphical user interface (GUI) tool, `PgAdmin` provides an easy-to-use interface for a variety of tasks: 

such as creating and modifying tables, executing SQL queries, and managing user permissions. 

Getting started with `PgAdmin` is easy; simply After installing it you can use the intuitive GUI to perform operations on your database, like creating and modifying database objects, running SQL scripts, and viewing query results. 

> For more advanced users, `PgAdmin` provides features like server groups, which let you organize your database servers into logical groups to make managing large numbers of servers easier.

-----------------

## Some Commonly used Aggregation Functions and Clauses in SQL, with examples in PostgreSQL.

### **AVG**
The `AVG` function is used to calculate the average value of a numerical column. Here's an example:

```
SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees;
```

##### This command will calculate the average salary of all employees in the employees table.

### **COUNT**
The `COUNT` function is used to count the number of rows that match a specified condition. Here's an example:

```
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employees WHERE department = 'Sales';
```
##### This command will count the number of employees in the Sales department.

### **MAX**
The `MAX` function is used to find the maximum value in a numerical column. Here's an example:

```
SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employees;
```

##### This command will find the highest salary among all employees in the employees table.

### **MIN**
The `MIN` function is used to find the minimum value in a numerical column. Here's an example:

```
SELECT MIN(salary) FROM employees;
```

##### This command will find the lowest salary among all employees in the employees table.

### **SUM**
The `SUM` function is used to calculate the total sum of a numerical column. Here's an example:

```
SELECT SUM(sales_amount) FROM sales;
```

##### This command will calculate the total sales amount from the sales table.

### **ROUND**
The `ROUND` function is used to round a numerical value to a specified number of decimal places. Here's an example:

```
SELECT ROUND(salary, 2) FROM employees;
```

##### This command will round the salary of all employees in the employees table to two decimal places.

### **GROUP BY**
The `GROUP BY` clause is used to group rows with similar values into summary rows. 

Here's an example:

```
SELECT department, AVG(salary) FROM employees 

GROUP BY department;
```

##### This command will group employees by department and calculate the average salary for each department.

When used with the `DATE()` function, it can group records based on the date component of a datetime column.


*For example*, let's say you have a table called `orders` with columns `order_id`, `customer_id`, `order_date`, and `order_amount`. You want to find the total order amount for each day in the month of January 2022.

You can use the `DATE()` function to extract the date component of the order_date column and then group the records by this date using the GROUP BY clause. Here's an example query:

```
SELECT DATE(order_date) as order_day, SUM(order_amount) as total_amount
FROM orders

WHERE order_date >= '2022-01-01' AND order_date < '2022-02-01'

GROUP BY DATE(order_date)

ORDER BY order_day;
```

##### In this query, the WHERE clause limits the records to those with an order_date in January 2022. The SELECT clause uses the DATE() function to extract the date component of order_date and aliases it as order_day. The SUM() function is used to calculate the total order amount for each order_day. Finally, the GROUP BY clause groups the records by order_day.

>The result of this query will be a table with two columns: order_day and total_amount. Each row will show the total order amount for a specific day in January 2022. The ORDER BY clause sorts the result set in ascending order by order_day.


### **ORDER BY**
The `ORDER BY` clause is used to sort the result set in ascending or descending order based on one or more columns. Here's an example:

```
SELECT department, AVG(salary) FROM employees 

GROUP BY department ORDER BY AVG(salary) DESC;
```

##### This command will group employees by department, calculate the average salary for each department, and sort the result set in descending order by average salary.

### **HAVING**
The `HAVING` clause is used to filter the result set based on a condition that involves an aggregate function. Here's an example:

"its like a WHERE statement but for the Aggregation Functions"
```
SELECT department, AVG(salary) FROM employees 

GROUP BY department 

HAVING AVG(salary) > 50000;
```
##### This command will group employees by department, calculate the average salary for each department, and filter the result set to show only departments where the average salary is greater than 50,000.

------------
# SQL join type and operator.

## **AS**
The `AS` operator is used to alias a table or column with a different name. It's especially useful when you need to rename columns or tables in the output to make it more readable and meaningful. The syntax for using the AS operator is:

```
SELECT column_name AS alias_name FROM table_name;
```

For example, in the query we showed earlier:

```
SELECT e.first_name, e.last_name, d.department_name AS dept_name
FROM employees e

INNER JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id;
```

##### We are aliasing the departments.department_name column as dept_name using the AS operator. This makes the output more readable and meaningful.

## INNER JOIN
The `INNER JOIN` operator returns only the rows that have matching values in both tables. It's used to combine the rows from two or more tables based on a common column. The syntax for using `INNER JOIN` is:

```
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1

INNER JOIN table2

ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;
```

For example:

```
SELECT e.first_name, e.last_name, d.department_name
FROM employees e

INNER JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id;
```

##### This query is using INNER JOIN to combine the employees table with the departments table based on the department_id column. The result set will include only the rows where there is a match in both tables.

## OUTER JOIN
The `OUTER JOIN` operator returns all the rows from one table and the matching rows from the other table. If there is no match in the other table, the result will include NULL values. 

There are two types of outer joins: `LEFT OUTER JOIN` and `RIGHT OUTER JOIN`.

### `LEFT OUTER JOIN` 
returns all the rows from the left table and the matching rows from the right table. If there is no match in the right table, the result will include NULL values.

```
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
LEFT OUTER JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;
```

### `RIGHT OUTER JOIN` 

returns all the rows from the right table and the matching rows from the left table. If there is no match in the left table, the result will include NULL values.

```
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
RIGHT OUTER JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;
```

For example:

```
SELECT e.first_name, e.last_name, d.department_name
FROM employees e

LEFT OUTER JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id;
```

In this query, the `LEFT OUTER JOIN` operator is used to join the employees table with the departments table based on the department_id column. The result set will include all the rows from the employees table and the matching rows from the departments table. If there is no match in the departments table, the department_name column will contain a NULL value.

### **FULL JOIN**
The `FULL JOIN` operator is used to combine the results of a LEFT JOIN and a RIGHT JOIN. It returns all the rows from both tables and matches the rows that have matching values in both tables. If there are no matching rows in one of the tables, the result set will contain NULL values for the columns of that table.

The syntax for a `FULL JOIN` is as follows:

```
SELECT column_names
FROM table1
FULL JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;
```

Here's an example of a FULL JOIN:

Suppose we have two tables, `"Customers"` and `"Orders"`. The `"Customers"` table has columns `"CustomerID"` and `"CustomerName"`, while the `"Orders"` table has columns `"OrderID"`, `"CustomerID"`, and `"OrderDate"`.

To get a list of all customers and their orders, we can use a `FULL JOIN` as follows:

```
SELECT Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderID, Orders.OrderDate
FROM Customers

FULL JOIN Orders

ON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID

ORDER BY Customers.CustomerName;
```

In this example, we join the two tables using the `"CustomerID"` column. The result set will include all customers, including those who have not placed any orders, and all orders, including those that have not been placed by any customers. 

If there is no matching customer for an order or no matching order for a customer, the corresponding columns in the result set will contain `NULL` values.

> Note that the `ORDER BY` clause is used to sort the result set by the `"CustomerName"` column. This clause can be used with any type of `JOIN` to sort the results according to a specific column.

------------------------

## Advanced SQL Commands:

### TimeStamps and Extract:
`TimeStamps` are a way to represent time and date values in SQL. The Extract function is used to extract specific parts of a timestamp, such as `year`, `month`, `day`, `hour`, `minute`, and `second`.

Here's an example query that uses the Extract function to get the month and year from a timestamp column:

```
SELECT EXTRACT(MONTH FROM timestamp_column) AS month,
       EXTRACT(YEAR FROM timestamp_column) AS year
FROM table_name;
```

### Math Functions:
SQL provides several built-in math functions, such as `ABS`, `ROUND`, `CEIL`, `FLOOR`, and `TRUNC`. These functions can be used to perform arithmetic operations and round numbers.

Here's an example query that uses the ROUND function to round a number to two decimal places:

```
SELECT ROUND(number_column, 2) AS rounded_number
FROM table_name;
```

### String Functions:
SQL also provides several built-in string functions, such as CONCAT, LENGTH, SUBSTR, UPPER, and LOWER. These functions can be used to manipulate string values.

Here's an example query that uses the CONCAT function to concatenate two columns:

```
SELECT CONCAT(column1, ' ', column2) AS full_name
FROM table_name;
```

### Sub-Query:
A `sub-query` is a query that is nested inside another query. It is used to retrieve data that will be used as input for the main query. Sub-queries can be used in the `SELECT`, `WHERE`, and `HAVING` clauses.

Here's an example query that uses a sub-query to get the average of a column:

```
SELECT AVG(column_name)
FROM (SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE condition) subquery_alias;
```

### Self-Join:
A `self-join` is a join operation where a table is joined with itself. It is used to relate rows within the same table.

Here's an example query that uses a self-join to find all pairs of employees who have the same manager:

```
SELECT a.employee_name, b.employee_name
FROM employees a
JOIN employees b
ON a.manager_id = b.manager_id
WHERE a.employee_name <> b.employee_name;
```

### To-Char:
The `To-Char` function is used to convert a value to a character string with a specified format. It is commonly used to format date and time values.

Here's an example query that uses the To-Char function to convert a date column to a specific format:

```
SELECT TO_CHAR(date_column, 'MM/DD/YYYY') AS formatted_date
FROM table_name;
```

## Tips & Tricks:

### TimeStamps and Extract:
- Timestamps can be stored in different formats, such as ISO 8601 or Unix time, and SQL has built-in functions to handle these formats.
- The `Extract` function can be used with different parts of a timestamp, such as microseconds, time zones, and time intervals.
- The `EXTRACT` function can also be used with INTERVAL values, which represent a duration of time.

### Math Functions:
- The `ROUND` function can be used with negative numbers to round to the left of the decimal point, such as rounding to the nearest thousand.
- The `CEIL` function rounds a number up to the nearest integer, while the FLOOR function rounds a number down to the nearest integer.
- The `TRUNC` function truncates a number to a specified number of decimal places.
String Functions:
- The `CONCAT` function can be used to concatenate more than two columns or strings, by using multiple arguments separated by commas.
- The `SUBSTR` function can be used to extract a substring from a string, by specifying the starting position and the length.
- The UPPER and LOWER functions can be used to convert a string to uppercase or lowercase, respectively.

### Sub-Query:
- Sub-queries can be nested inside other sub-queries, allowing for complex queries to be constructed.
- Sub-queries can also be used to perform aggregate functions, such as AVG, MAX, and MIN.
- Sub-queries can be used in the WHERE clause to filter rows based on a sub-set of data.

### Self-Join:
- Self-joins can be used to represent hierarchical or recursive relationships, such as a manager-employee relationship or a parent-child relationship.
- Self-joins can be used to find duplicates or matching records within the same table.
- Self-joins can be combined with other SQL commands, such as `GROUP BY` and `HAVING`, to further refine the query results.

### To-Char:
- The TO_CHAR function can be used with a wide range of format codes, such as month `names`, `day names`, and `time zones`.
- The TO_CHAR function can be combined with other SQL commands, such as `WHERE` and `ORDER` `BY`, to filter and sort data based on formatted date values.
- The TO_CHAR function can also be used with numeric and boolean values, allowing for flexible formatting options.

## Creating Databases Using SQL.

### `Data Types:`
SQL provides a variety of data types that can be used to define the structure of a database. The most common data types include:
- Numeric (e.g. INT, FLOAT)
- Character (e.g. CHAR, VARCHAR)
- Date/time (e.g. DATE, TIME, TIMESTAMP)
- Boolean (e.g. BOOLEAN)

Each data type has specific properties and usage scenarios, and it's important to choose the appropriate data type for each column in your database.

>In addition to the common data types mentioned earlier, there are several other data types that can be used in SQL databases. Here are a few examples:

- UUID: Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) is a data type that generates unique identifiers for rows in a table. This type is commonly used in distributed systems to ensure unique identification of records across multiple databases.

- JSON: JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a data type that stores data in a structured format similar to a JavaScript object. This type is commonly used for storing and exchanging data between web applications and services.

- Network Address: Some databases support data types for network addresses, such as IPv4 or IPv6 addresses. These types can be used to store and manipulate network-related data.

- Geospatial: Some databases support data types for geospatial data, such as points, lines, and polygons. These types can be used to store and query location-based data.

- Array: Some databases support data types for arrays, which can store a collection of values of the same data type. This type can be used to store and manipulate data in a more flexible and structured manner.


### Explanation for Primary and Foreign Keys:

- ### `Primary Key`:

A primary key is a column or a set of columns in a table that uniquely identifies each row in the table. This means that no two rows can have the same values in their primary key columns. 

The primary key is used as a reference point for other tables that have a foreign key relationship with the primary key table. A primary key is essential for maintaining data integrity, as it ensures that each row is uniquely identified and can be referenced by other tables.

- ### `Foreign Key`:

A foreign key is a column or a set of columns in a table that refers to the primary key of another table. This creates a relationship between two tables and allows data to be linked across multiple tables. 

For example, if you have a "`Customers`" table and an "`Orders`" table, the "`Orders`" table could have a foreign key column that refers to the primary key of the "`Customers`" table. This would allow you to link each order to a specific customer, ensuring that data is consistent and accurate.

When a foreign key is defined, it enforces referential integrity, which means that the values in the foreign key column must match the values in the primary key column of the referenced table. This ensures that data is always consistent and valid, as it prevents the creation of orphaned records (i.e. records with no corresponding reference in the primary key table).


## `Constraints` 
are a crucial aspect of database design, as they define the rules and limits for the data that can be stored in a table. Here are some common constraints found in `SQL`:

- `NOT NULL`: This constraint ensures that a column cannot contain null values. It is used to enforce mandatory data entry for a column.

- `UNIQUE`: This constraint ensures that a column contains only unique values. It is used to prevent duplicate data from being entered into a column.

- `PRIMARY KEY (PK)`: This constraint is used to define a column or a set of columns as the primary key for a table. It ensures that each row in the table has a unique identifier, and can be referenced by other tables using a foreign key constraint.

- `FOREIGN KEY (FK)`: This constraint is used to define a column or a set of columns as a foreign key for a table. It establishes a relationship between two tables by referencing the primary key of another table.

- `CHECK`: This constraint enforces a condition that must be true for a column value. It is used to restrict the range of data that can be entered into a column.

- `DEFAULT`: This constraint assigns a default value to a column if no value is specified. It is used to ensure that a column always has a value, even if one is not specified during data entry.

- `EXCLUSION`: This constraint is used to define exclusion constraints between rows in a table. It ensures that no two rows in a table have conflicting data values for specific columns.

- `REFERENCES`: This constraint is used to define a foreign key constraint on a table. It specifies the referenced table and the columns in that table that are being referenced by the foreign key constraint.

By using constraints, you can ensure that your data is consistent, accurate, and valid. Constraints help to enforce data integrity and prevent errors, while also making it easier to manage and query your data.

------

## `CREATE`
The `CREATE` statement in SQL is used to create a new database object, such as a table, index, view, or stored procedure. The basic syntax for creating a table in SQL is as follows:

```
CREATE TABLE table_name (
    column1 datatype constraints,
    column2 datatype constraints,
    ...
    columnN datatype constraints
);
```
In this statement, `table_name` is the name of the table you want to create, `column1` through `columnN` are the names of the columns in the table, `datatype` is the data type for each column, and constraints are any additional constraints or rules that you want to apply to the column.

### SERIAL:
The `SERIAL` data type is a special data type in PostgreSQL that is used to generate unique sequence numbers for a column. 

>When you define a column as `SERIAL`, `PostgreSQL` will automatically generate a unique sequence number for each new row that is inserted into the table. 

The basic syntax for defining a column as SERIAL in SQL is as follows:

```
CREATE TABLE table_name (
    column_name SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    ...
);
```

In this statement, column_name is the name of the column you want to define as SERIAL, and the PRIMARY KEY constraint ensures that the column is also a primary key for the table. When a new row is inserted into the table, PostgreSQL will automatically generate a unique sequence number for the column_name column.

`SERIAL` is a convenient way to automatically generate unique identifiers for a table, such as primary keys. It eliminates the need to manually generate unique identifiers, and ensures that each row in the table has a unique identifier. 

>However, it is important to note that SERIAL is specific to PostgreSQL, and other database systems may use different methods for generating unique identifiers.

---

## `INSERT` 
statement in SQL is used to insert data into a table. Here's a breakdown of the syntax and some details about how it works:

Basic Syntax:
```
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, ..., columnN)
VALUES (value1, value2, ..., valueN);
```

In this statement, `table_name` is the name of the table you want to insert data into, `column1` through `columnN` are the names of the columns you want to insert data into, and `value1` through `valueN` are the values you want to insert into the corresponding columns. The number of columns and values must match, or you will get an error.

You can also insert multiple rows of data at once, by separating each set of values with a comma:

```
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, ..., columnN)
VALUES (value1, value2, ..., valueN),
       (value1, value2, ..., valueN),
       ...,
       (value1, value2, ..., valueN);

```
If you want to insert data into all columns in the table, you can omit the column list:

```
INSERT INTO table_name
VALUES (value1, value2, ..., valueN);
```

#### `Some additional details about the INSERT statement:`

- If you are inserting a value into a column with a data type of CHAR, VARCHAR, or TEXT, you must enclose the value in single quotes.

- If you are inserting a value into a column with a data type of DATE or TIMESTAMP, you must use the appropriate format for the date or timestamp.

- If you are inserting data into a table with a foreign key constraint, you must ensure that the value you are inserting matches a value in the primary key column of the referenced table.

- If you are inserting a large amount of data, it may be more efficient to use a bulk insert method, such as COPY or INSERT INTO SELECT.

- If you are inserting data into a table with an auto-incrementing primary key column, you can omit the primary key column from the INSERT statement, and the database will automatically generate a new value for the column.

Overall, the `INSERT` statement is a fundamental part of working with `SQL` databases, and understanding how to use it effectively is essential for working with data in a database.

----

## `UPDATE` 
statement in SQL is used to modify existing data in a table. Here's a breakdown of the syntax and some details about how it works:

Basic Syntax:
```
UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ..., columnN = valueN
WHERE condition;
```

In this statement, `table_name` is the name of the table you want to update, `column1` through `columnN` are the names of the columns you want to modify, and `value1` through `valueN` are the new values you want to set for the corresponding columns. 

The `WHERE` clause specifies which rows you want to update based on a condition that you define. If you omit the WHERE clause, all rows in the table will be updated.

#### `Some additional details about the UPDATE statement`:

- You can update multiple columns at once by separating each column and value pair with a comma.

- You can use arithmetic expressions, functions, and subqueries in the SET clause to calculate new values for the columns you are updating.

- The condition in the WHERE clause can be any valid Boolean expression that evaluates to true or false.

- If you want to update all rows in a table, you can use the following syntax:

    ```
    UPDATE table_name
    SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ..., columnN = valueN;
    ```

- If you want to update a single row in a table, you can use the LIMIT clause to limit the number of rows that are updated:
    ```
    UPDATE table_name
    SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ..., columnN = valueN
    WHERE condition
    LIMIT 1;
    ```
- If you are updating a large amount of data, it may be more efficient to use a bulk update method, such as UPDATE FROM or MERGE.

- If you are updating a table with a foreign key constraint, you must ensure that the new value you are setting matches a value in the primary key column of the referenced table.

Overall, the `UPDATE` statement is a powerful tool for modifying data in a `SQL` database, and understanding how to use it effectively is essential for managing data in a database.

----
## `DELETE` 
statement in SQL is used to remove data from a table. Here's a breakdown of the syntax and some details about how it works:

Basic Syntax:
```
DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

In this statement, `table_name` is the name of the table you want to delete data from, and the `WHERE` clause specifies which rows you want to delete based on a condition that you define. If you omit the WHERE clause, all rows in the table will be deleted.

#### `Some additional details about the DELETE statement:`

- Be very careful when using the DELETE statement, as it permanently removes data from the table. Always make a backup of your data before deleting anything.

- You can use the `TRUNCATE TABLE` statement to delete all rows from a table without logging individual row deletions. This can be faster than using the DELETE statement, but it cannot be rolled back.

- If you want to delete a single row from a table, you can use the `LIMIT` clause to limit the number of rows that are deleted:

    ```
    DELETE FROM table_name
    WHERE condition
    LIMIT 1;
    ```
- If you have a table with a foreign key constraint, you must delete any dependent rows in other tables first, or use the `ON DELETE CASCADE` option to automatically delete dependent rows when the parent row is deleted.

- If you want to delete data from multiple tables at once, you can use the `DELETE FROM` statement with a JOIN clause to specify how the tables are related:

    ```
    DELETE t1, t2
    FROM table1 t1
    JOIN table2 t2 ON t1.id = t2.id
    WHERE condition;
    ```
- If you are deleting a large amount of data, it may be more efficient to use a bulk delete method, such as `DELETE FROM` with a `subquery` or `TRUNCATE TABLE`.

Overall, the DELETE statement is an important tool for managing data in a SQL database, but it should be used with caution to avoid accidentally deleting important data.

## `ALTER` 
statement in `SQL` is used to modify the structure of a table, such as adding, modifying or dropping columns, changing the data type of columns, adding or dropping constraints, and more. Here's a breakdown of the syntax and some details about how it works:

Basic Syntax:
```
ALTER TABLE table_name
ACTION;
```
In this statement, `table_name` is the name of the table you want to modify, and `ACTION` is the specific modification you want to make to the table. Here are some common actions you can perform with ALTER:

`ADD COLUMN:` adds a new column to the table. Here's an example:
```
ALTER TABLE table_name
ADD COLUMN column_name data_type;
```

`MODIFY COLUMN`: changes the data type of an existing column. Here's an example:
```
ALTER TABLE table_name
MODIFY COLUMN column_name new_data_type;
```

`DROP COLUMN`: removes a column from the table. Here's an example:
```
ALTER TABLE table_name
DROP COLUMN column_name;
```

`ADD CONSTRAINT`: adds a constraint to the table, such as a primary key or foreign key constraint. Here's an example:
```
ALTER TABLE table_name
ADD CONSTRAINT constraint_name PRIMARY KEY (column_name);
```

`DROP CONSTRAINT`: removes a constraint from the table. Here's an example:
```
ALTER TABLE table_name
DROP CONSTRAINT constraint_name;
```

#### `Some additional details about the ALTER statement:`

- Be very careful when using the `ALTER` statement, as it can have a significant impact on your database schema and the data stored in the table. Always make a backup of your data before making any changes.

- Some modifications to the table may require rebuilding the table, which can be a time-consuming process for large tables with a lot of data.

- If you are modifying a table with existing data, you may need to update the data in the table to conform to the new schema.

- Some database management systems have specific rules and limitations for the ALTER statement, so be sure to consult your system's documentation for more information.

Overall, the `ALTER` statement is an important tool for modifying the structure of a SQL table and ensuring that your database schema is up-to-date and optimized for your needs.

## `DROP` 
statement is used to remove database objects such as tables, indexes, views, and more. Here's a breakdown of the syntax and some details about how it works:

Basic Syntax:
```
DROP OBJECT_TYPE IF EXISTS object_name;
```
In this statement, `OBJECT_TYPE` is the type of object you want to drop, such as TABLE, INDEX, VIEW, etc. `IF EXISTS` is an optional clause that prevents an error from being thrown if the object does not exist. `OBJECT_NAME` is the name of the object you want to drop. Here are some examples of how to use the `DROP statement:`

```
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS table_name;
```

`Drop an index:`

```
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS index_name;
```

`Drop a view:`

```
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS view_name;
```

#### `Some additional details about the DROP statement:`

- Be very careful when using the DROP statement, as it will permanently remove the object from your database. Always make a backup of your data before dropping any objects.

- If the object being dropped has dependent objects, such as foreign key constraints, the DROP statement may fail. In this case, you will need to drop the dependent objects first.

- Some database management systems have specific rules and limitations for the DROP statement, so be sure to consult your system's documentation for more information.

Overall, the `DROP` statement is an important tool for managing your SQL database objects and keeping your schema organized and optimized.

## `Check Constraints`
 in SQL are used to enforce specific conditions that must be met for values in a table column. The purpose of a check constraint is to ensure that data entered into a table meets certain criteria or rules.

`Here's an example of how to create a check constraint on a table:`

```
CREATE TABLE employees (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT,
  age INTEGER,
  salary REAL,
  department TEXT,
  hire_date DATE,
  CONSTRAINT age_check CHECK (age >= 18)
);
```

In this example, a `CHECK` constraint is defined on the age column of the employees table, which ensures that the value of the age column is always greater than or equal to 18. If a value is inserted into the age column that violates this constraint, an error will be thrown.

#### `Some key things to keep in mind about check constraints include:`

- Check constraints can be defined at the column level or the table level.
- Check constraints can reference other columns in the same table or external tables using subqueries.
- Check constraints can also use Boolean expressions, logical operators, and comparison operators to define complex rules for data validation.
- Check constraints can be added or removed using the ALTER TABLE statement.
- When defining check constraints, it's important to ensure that they do not conflict with other constraints, such as primary and foreign keys, to avoid conflicts and errors.

Overall, check constraints are an important tool for ensuring data quality and maintaining the integrity of your database schema. By defining rules that must be met for data to be inserted or updated in a table, you can help prevent data inconsistencies and errors.
