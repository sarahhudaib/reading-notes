# Linear Regressions

## Regressions
As predictive analytics is a tool for machine learning and big data, regression modeling is a tool for predictive analytics—one of the primary tools in fact. Regression analysis entails looking at dependent variables (outcomes) and an independent variable (the action) while also assessing the strength in the association between them. In other words, it looks to understand if there is a relationship between variables and how strong that relationship is.

## Linear Regressions
Linear regression is a statistical method for modeling relationships between a dependent variable with a given set of independent variables.

>> we're looking at tools for predictive analysis. A key tool for that analysis is Linear Regressions.

## Role of regressions in predictive analysis
Through the collection of large amounts of data, `predictive analytics` `is the use of statistical modeling, algorithms, and other techniques in order to predict future outcomes`. 

Predicting outcomes doesn’t always entail any one process but depends on the type of data being collected and the methods used. There are also different classifications of predictive analytics:

- `Predictive` is the most obvious classification of predictive analytics. It uses past behavior to predict the propensity for a specific outcome to occur in the future.
- `Descriptive` analytics uses sets of behaviors to describe relationships between them.
- `Decision` analytics, similar to predictive, uses known behaviors and outcomes to predict future sets of outcomes like a decision tree to predict behaviors (not just singular outcomes).


## Dependent and Independent variables
 The outcome variable is also called the `response` or `dependent variable`, and the risk factors and confounders are called the `predictors`, or `explanatory` or `independent variables`. In regression analysis, the `dependent` variable is denoted `"Y"` and the `independent` variables are denoted by `"X"`
