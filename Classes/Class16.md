# Serverless Functions
Serverless is a cloud execution model that enables a simpler, more cost-effective way to build and operate cloud-native applications.

## What is serverless?
Serverless is a cloud computing execution model that 

- Automatically provisions the computing resources required to run application code on demand, or in response to a specific event;
- Automatically scales those resources up or down in response to increased or decreased demand;
- Automatically scales resources to zero when the application stops running. 

## Serverless pros and cons
### `Pros`

- Serverless enables development teams to focus on writing code, not managing infrastructure.

- Serverless customers pay for execution only. 

- Serverless is a polyglot environment, enabling developers to code in any language or framework - Java, Python, node.js.

- Serverless simplifies deployment and, in a larger sense, simplifies DevOps cycles.

- Serverless application development platforms provide near-total visibility into system and user times, and can aggregate that information systematically.

### `Cons`

- Stable or predictable workloads
- Cold starts
- Monitoring and debugging
- Vendor lock-in
