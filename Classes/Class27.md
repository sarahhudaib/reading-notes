# Graphs: Introduction
Graphs are non-linear data structures made up of two major components:

- `Vertices` – Vertices are entities in a graph. Every vertex has a value associated with it. For example, if we represent a list of cities using a graph, the vertices would represent the cities.

- `Edges` – Edges represent the relationship between the vertices in the graph. Edges may or may not have a value associated with them. For example, if we represent a list of cities using a graph, the edges would represent the path between the cities.

## Applications of Graphs
Graphs are used everywhere, from schooling to business. Especially in the fields of computer science, physics, and chemistry.

A few other applications of graphs are:

- To visualize organized data.

- Directed Graphs are used in Google’s Page Ranking Algorithm.

- Social Networks use graphs to represent different users as vertices and edges to represent the connections between them.

- In a mapping application, graphs are used to represent places and the path (distance) between them.

## Types of Graphs
There are many types of graphs, based on weights, direction, interconnectivity, and special properties. Let’s look at the most common types of graphs.

- Graphs Based on Direction
- Graphs Based on Weights
- Special Graphs

## Representing Graphs
There are multiple ways of using data structures to represent a graph. The three most common ways are:

- Adjacency Matrix
- Adjacency List
- Edge List


## Conclusion
In this article, we learned about the various types of graphs, their representations, and their applications.
