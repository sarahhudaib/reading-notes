> The mistake most weak pianists make is playing, not practicing. If you walk into a music hall at a local university, you’ll hear people ‘playing’ by running through their pieces.

# Measuring Emotional Intelligence

> Emotional Intelligence is learnable and developmental.

           since I score below 18 in this section I need to focus and learn more about it I always thought that emotional intelligence is something that you cant learn because you got it from your environment and the way you grew up but apparently I'm wrong about it and I still have the chance to learn & develop myself.
