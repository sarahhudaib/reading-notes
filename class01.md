# Read: Class 01 - Code 401
## Suffering is pain without purpose. Pain with no higher goal. Pain with no dreams, no ambition, no aspiration.

### After 10 weeks i'll be able to answer these questions 

- What’s your perspective?
- Why are you doing this?
- Do you want what comes at the end of this journey?
- Are you doing this for you?

# REMINDER for the future me --> Don’t experience the pain in silence! 

It’s not easy, nor is it common. This is why such skilled people are highly-valued in the industry. 
You are building your value. You are experiencing the pain of growth. **Live it, love it** , 
and take it forward into your future as a full-stack software developer capable of meeting all challenges with a clear head and strong heart.

# A beginner's guide to Big-O Notation:

> The Big-O notation is an essential tool for computer scientists to analyze the complexity and cost of an algorithm, 
and an important practice for software engineers to understand algorithms more deeply.

## Good Code: 
- Readability 
- Scalable (Big O)

**Every computer will take a different time to run this code there are a lot of factors to consider like CPU, what I’m running on my pc, what other programming languages are using etc.**

### So how to know whose have better codes?
> Big-O notation  talks about how much my code takes time to run
